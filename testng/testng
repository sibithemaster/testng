TESTNG:

It is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit
but introducing some more functionalities that make 
it more powerful and easier to use.

TestNG is used to cover all the categories of test:

unit
functional
end to end
integration


ADVANTAGES:
Manage test suite and test cases
Helps in prioritizing of tests
Helps in grouping of tests
parallel execution
Reporting



Assertion in TESTNG:
Assert.assertTrue()
Assert.assertFalse()
Assert.assertEquals()

If test case fails for particular Assert
then there wont be no test will run after Assert.assertTrue()->Fails

SoftAssert:
We need to create object for SoftAssert.
To terminate softAssert we need to give softAssert.assertALL();
It will show all the failed test cases at the end of process.

DATAPROVIDER IN TESTNG:
Apart from parameters, there is another way to achieve 
parameterization which is by using Data Provider.


PARALLEL TESTING:
Run methods
Run test
Run suite
